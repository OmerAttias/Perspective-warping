# Perspective-warping
Plant an image within a video on top of existing image while adjusting the dynamic perspective of the original image in the video


- the main goal for this project is to first knowing the agumented rality world.
- the mission was to take a random image and implement it on a video which contain another image. the new implemented image should "behave" in dynamic perspective identical to the original one.
- For the explantion lets call the original image "template image" and for the new image "target image".
- first i took a single frame from the video in order to analyze the template image. i change the image color to geray scale image and search for "Key points".
